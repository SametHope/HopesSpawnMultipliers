This mod provides the flexibility to fine-tune NPC spawn rates and spawn limits within the range of 1x to 1000x, with increments of 1.

It's important to note that these changes are both relative and proportional to their vanilla counterparts.
This ensures that rare spawns will not become more likely than regular spawns, maintaining a balanced and consistent gameplay experience.
